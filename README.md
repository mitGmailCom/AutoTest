# AutoTest
This solution demonstrates automated testing web pages with Selenium and C#.NET. It can also be used as a template for new Selenium test projects.

Three tests are included that run tests on the publically available demo website Altoro Mutual available at http://prestashop-automation.qatestlab.com.ua/ru. The tests test logging onto the website and transferring an amount between two accounts.

The tests can be executed on three browsers: Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer. 
Uncoment atribute TestFixture for run in some browser. in project I used NUnit.
